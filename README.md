# League Learning

League Learning is a python tool that will allow you to see stats of League of Legends players as well as make educated guesses about outcomes of games. Work in progress.

## Currently finished:

    * Basic W/L statistic for recent games

## Need to do:

    * Get ability to poll player game status (in game or not)
    * Perform a learning test on test data set -> logistic regression
    * Perform a test on the fly at various points throughout a game
    * Wrap up project into a simple user interface
## Extras:

    * Possibly data visualization of various stats
    * Bayesian Inferencing in real-time for players in game (need a thorough GUI for ease of input, API does not allow for spectator mode in real-time)
